### Contributing to the Global Sprint
Thanks for your interest in contributing to the 'Peek District' for the Mozilla's Global Sprint 2017.

This is our Github presence during the Global Sprint running June 1-2, 2017.

I'll be based out of the Mozilla London office which is currently in the timezone UTC +1 or British Summer Time (BST).

These files will be changing, especially in the lead up to the that event date.
