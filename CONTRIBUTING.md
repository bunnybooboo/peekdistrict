### Contributing to the Global Sprint

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the 'Peek District' for the Mozilla's Global Sprint 2017.

This is our Github presence during the Global Sprint running June 1-2, 2017.

I'll be based out of the Mozilla London office which is currently in the timezone UTC +1 or British Summer Time (BST).

These files will be changing, especially in the lead up to the that event date.

### Participation Guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to davross@protonmail.com.

### How to Get Started

To start with, we are eleborating upon other people's work on Open Street Map. This is already not a unique project, and your contribution will assist a greater privacy effort globally.

As a reflection of this, we are initially using the same framework they have started. (LINK TBD) Additional to this I have previously used Open Data Kit (ODK) during a Missing Maps London Working Group experiment. ODK has a phone/tablet app on Android called ODK. This will allow contributors to build their own local database. This could be used offline, hosted on your own server, and even stored in the cloud. (ODK Connect tutorial TBD). 

We will not be using a collaborative database, as Open Street Map will handle this for us.

If you have suggestions or changes to this initial workflow, [create an issue](https://github.com/peekdistrict/peekdistrict/issues), or submit a change as set out in the next section.

### Contributing Data to Open Street Map

#### How to Map on Open Street Map

As a rather long standing opens source project, Open Street Map has a large number of ways to contribute open data. More specifically to Peek District:

  * local knowledge (mark any estimations in OSM with `fixme=*`)
  * GPS tagging - ODK Connect (Android) etc.
  * On the Web - OSM's ID editor [Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) and [Login](www.openstreetmap.org/login?referer=%2Fedit%3Feditor%3Did)
  * Desktop app - OSM's JOSM editor [Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) and [Download](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)
